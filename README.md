# Connecting_Shapes

Objective: To predict a path by following the below instructions

1.	There are 8 figures given below with different shapes and areas.
 	You need to find the number of sides of the figures and arrange the
 	figures in ascending order of their number of sides.
	(triangle < quadrilateral < pentagon < hexagon < circle)

2.	In case you have two figures having the same number of sides then 
	you will arrange the figure in ascending order of their area.
	(triangle(pink) < triangle(yellow))

3.	According to your above order draw contours around the figure and 
	just above the contour write the order number. For example, in the
	below picture the triangle with pink color will be labeled 1 and 
	the triangle with yellow color will be labeled 2 and the square will
	be labeled 3 and similarly complete for the total image.

4.	You also have to connect the center of 1 with 2 by drawing a line and
	similarly 2 with 3  and similarly connect all the figures in the above
	order and by connecting all the centers you will finally get a path.
